# Bike Sharing Rental Prediction
---
This project uses a simple MLP architechture to predict daily bike rental ridership. <br> <br>
The MLP is built only using numpy and pandas and the gradient descent steps are made from scratch including forward pass, backpropagation, loss calculation and weights updatation. <br>
Finally, the MLP model is trained on the [dataset](https://github.com/Arjunp24/bike-sharing-rental-prediction/blob/master/Bike-Sharing-Dataset/Readme.txt) and the training and validation losses are recorded.
